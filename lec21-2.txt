Be careful to differentiate between:

Performance: How much time/memory/disk/etc. is used when a program is run. This depends on the machine, compiler, etc. as well as the code we write.
Complexity: How do the resource requirements of a program or algorithm scale, i.e. what happens as the size of the problem being solved by the code gets larger.
Note: Complexity affects performance but not vice-versa.

Algorithm Analysis:
Algorithm analysis is an important part of computational complexity
theory, which provides theoretical estimation for the required resources of an algorithm to solve a specific computational problem. Analysis of algorithms is the determination of the amount of time and space resources required to execute it.
